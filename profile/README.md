## Hi there 👋

***🌱Drycc, the only Container as a Service (CaaS) you need.***

🔥Native to Kubernetes, Drycc is the Container as a Service suite available on every public cloud, every Kubernetes distribution, the private cloud and the edge.

🤝Open Source from Day One. Leverage the power of global innovation with the leading database open source community.

✨Both X86 and ARM64 are supported with binaries and multiarch images available for both. Drycc works great from something as small as a AWS a1.4xlarge 32GiB server.
